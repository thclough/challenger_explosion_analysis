# Challenger Incident Analysis
#### By: Tighe Clough

On January 28th, 1986, a nation watched in disbelief as the space shuttle *Challenger* exploded after lift-off. The disaster resulted in the deaths of all seven crew members, NASA's first in-flight fatalities. Investigation attributed the malfunction to O-ring seal failure under abnormally cold conditions. Temperature analysis provides further insight into the cause of the disaster.

Inverse distance-weighted temperature data from weather stations can be used to calculate average temperatures at the launch location (Cape Canaveral, Florida) in 1986:

As shown in the graph, NASA decided to launch the *Challenger* during an extremely cold day in Cape Canaveral. In fact, freezing temperatures had caused ice to form on the launch structures. The team of booster rocket engineers opposed the launch given that the O-rings had failed in testing under much higher temperatures (53Â°F). However, NASA officials prioritizing a timely launch won over; *Challenger* was given the green light.

Visualization of the cold wave that swept over Florida on the day of the launch further demonstrates the unfavorability of conditions. The cold wave bulged to cover the entire Florida peninsula:

Findsight shows that waiting would have been beneficial. Temperatures had restabilized only a few days after that tragic day:

If NASA officials had exercised more patience, they could have avoided such a disaster. Unfortunately, the series of events on January 28th, 1986 will forever scar NASA's history.
