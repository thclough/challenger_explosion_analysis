# Challenger Incident Analysis
#### By: Tighe Clough

On January 28th, 1986, a nation watched in disbelief as the space shuttle *Challenger* exploded after lift-off. The disaster resulted in the deaths of all seven crew members, NASA's first in-flight fatalities. Further investigation attributed the malfunction to O-ring seal failure under abnormally cold conditions. Temperature analysis provides further insight into the disaster.

Inverse distance-weighted temperature data from weather stations can be used to calculate average temperatures at the launch location (Cape Canaveral, Florida) in 1986:

As shown in the graph, NASA decided to launch the *Challenger* during an extremely cold day in Cape Canaveral. In fact, freezing temperatures had caused ice to form on the launch structures. The team of engineers in charge of the booster rockets opposed the launch given the O-rings had failed in testing under much higher temperatures (53Â°F). However, NASA officials pressuring for a timely launch won over; *Challenger* was given the green light.

Visualization of the cold wave that swept over Florida on the day of the launch further demonstrates the unfavorability of conditions:

The gift of hindsight provides us with an idea of what might have occurred with more waiting. Temperatures had restabilized only a few days after that tragic day:

If NASA officials had exercised more patience, they could have avoided such a disaster. Unfortunately, the series of events on January 28th, 1986 will forever scar NASA's history.
